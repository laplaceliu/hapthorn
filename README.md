# Hapthorn
Hapthorn is a project I'm working on to implement Activity Streams sort of like Mastodon but in .NET.
It's also a way for me to keep my finger in the ASP.NET Core, Angular, and Docker ecosystems while also writing some Open Source.

*Hapthorn isn't ready to use yet.*

## About the Name
The name Hapthorn comes from a character in the [Matthew Hughes Archonate universe](http://www.matthewhughes.org/the-archonate-bookstore/nine-tales-of-henghis-hapthorn/). You should read his books, Matt's my favourite author.
