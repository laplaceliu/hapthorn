# Hapthorn
Hapthorn is a project I'm working on to implement [ActivityPub](http://w3c.github.io/activitypub/) sort of like [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) but in [ASP.NET Core](http://www.asp.net/core).
It's also a way for me to keep my finger in the [ASP.NET Core](http://www.asp.net/core), [Angular](https://angular.io/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ecosystems while also writing some Open Source.

*Hapthorn isn't ready to use yet.*

## About the Name
The name Hapthorn comes from a character in the [Matthew Hughes Archonate universe](http://www.matthewhughes.org/the-archonate-bookstore/nine-tales-of-henghis-hapthorn/). You should read his books, Matt's my favourite author.
